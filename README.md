# MALT
MALT, an accessible malware analysis tool crafted with Java and MongoDB. This individual project aimed to democratize cybersecurity by automating the process of static malware analysis, offering a simple GUI tailored for new Malware analysts. Notably, MALT's intuitive interface guided users through the analysis process, facilitating streamlined analysis and even enabling the creation of basic YARA rules based on static analysis. Additionally, the tool generated comprehensive reports for easy comprehension and sharing of findings. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of JAVA and MongoDB, gaining valuable insights into their practical applications.

Features:
1. Automated static malware analysis
2. Intuitive GUI for new users
